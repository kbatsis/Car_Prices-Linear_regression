This project concerns the construction of a linear regression model for the prediction of used car prices in the UK market. It is based on datasets of 108,540 scraped used car listings, split into car brand, recovered from kaggle. These include information on prices, mileage, miles per gallon, engine size, year of production, transmission type and fuel type. We merged the sets into a single dataset and added the car brand as an extra variable. Price will serve as the dependent variable and the rest of the mentioned variables will serve as our independent variables. The analysis was performed with Anaconda Python 3.8 and the statsmodels module.
